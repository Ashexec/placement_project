In this project we will implement A* Path Finding algorithm using python.  
We will be building a path finding visualizer tool using python library Pygame to visualize the a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs. 
This astar pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which mean it is much more efficient that your standard algorithms like 
breadth first search or depth first search.
